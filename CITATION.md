journal = {Research Notes of the AAS},
abstract = {Over the past two decades, mass–radius relations have become a crucial tool for inferring the bulk composition of exoplanets using only their measured masses and radii. These relations, often referred to as isocomposition curves, are derived from interior structure models by calculating the theoretical radius as a function of mass for a given fixed planetary composition. Each mass–radius curve can be influenced by a variety of parameters, such as planetary composition, age, and equilibrium temperature. Navigating this parameter space can be cumbersome, particularly when models or their results are not open-source. To address this challenge, I have developed MAss–Radius DIaGRAm with Sliders, a visualization tool that enables simple, fast, and interactive exploration of the parameter space that governs mass–radius relations for any given model.}
