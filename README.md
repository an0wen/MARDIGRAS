# MARDIGRAS
The MAss-Radius DIaGRAm with Sliders (MARDIGRAS) is a visualization tool that allows a simple and easy manipulation of mass-radius relationships (also known as iso-composition curves) with interactive sliders.

To run the program, download the repository and run with python:
```
git clone https://github.com/an0wen/MARDIGRAS
cd MARDIGRAS
python mardigras.py
```
Three curves are controlled by sliders:
1. Aguichine et al. 2021 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914...84A/abstract), where the envelope is pure water in supercritical state, and a pure steam atmosphere ontop
2. Lopez & Fortney 2014 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...792....1L/abstract), where the envelope is made of gas with 1xSolar to 50xSolar metallicity
3. Zeng et al. 2016 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...819..127Z/abstract), for terrestrial planets with variable (iron) core mass fraction

5 static profiles from Zeng et al. 2016 are also shown, from bottom to top: pure iron core, Earth-like, pure mantle, 50% liquid water, and 100% liquid water.

Finally, three exoplanet populations are shown:
1. Full exoplanet catalog in the background
2. A smaller sample of highlighted targets
3. Planets of the Solar System
